# OnlineMultiplayerTest
This is my first networking test. Feel free to download my project if you need help on this.
Make sure to import hlapi from package manager or use mirror. If you use mirror, make sure to Import Mirror at the beginning of player setup. I used DaniDev's movement script for this simple test. Go subscribe to him on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/danidev
